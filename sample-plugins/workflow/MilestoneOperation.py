=== Example ===
{{{
[ticket-workflow]
resolve.operations = set_resolution,set_milestone
resolve.milestone = invalid,wontfix,duplicate,worksforme->rejected
}}}

When setting status to `duplicate` the milestone will automatically change
to `rejected`.

'''Note:''' if user has changed milestone manually, this workflow operation
has ''no effect''!

=== Configuration ===
Don't forget to add `MilestoneOperation` to the workflow option
in `[ticket]` section. If there is no workflow option, the line will look
like this:
{{{
[ticket]
workflow = ConfigurableTicketWorkflow,MilestoneOperation
}}}
